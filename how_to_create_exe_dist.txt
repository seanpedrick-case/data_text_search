1. Create minimal environment to run the app in conda. E.g. 'conda create --name new_env'

2. Activate the environment 'conda activate new_env'

3. cd to this folder. Install packages from requirements.txt using 'pip install -r requirements.txt' 

4. In file explorer, navigate to the miniconda/envs/new_env/Lib/site-packages/gradio-client/ folder

5. Copy types.json from the gradio_client folder to the folder containing the data_text_search.py file

6. pip install pyinstaller

7. In command line, cd to this folder. Then run the following 'python -m PyInstaller --additional-hooks-dir=. --hidden-import pyarrow.vendored.version --add-data="types.json;gradio_client" --clean --onefile --clean --name DataSearchApp data_text_search.py'

8. A 'dist' folder will be created with the executable inside along with all dependencies('dist\data_text_search'). 

9. In file explorer, navigate to the miniconda/envs/new_env/Lib/site-packages/gradio/ folder. Copy the entire folder. Paste this into the new distributable subfolder 'dist\data_text_search\_internal'

10. In 'dist\data_text_search' try double clicking on the .exe file. After a short delay, the command prompt should inform you about the ip address of the app that is now running. Copy the ip address, but do not close this window.

11. In an Internet browser, navigate to the indicated IP address. The app should now be running in your browser window.
