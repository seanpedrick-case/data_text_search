Search through long-form text fields in your tabular data. Either for exact, specific terms (Keyword search), or thematic, 'fuzzy' search (Semantic search).

# Guide
## Keyword search

1. Load in your tabular data file (.csv, .parquet, .xlsx - first sheet).
2. Wait a few seconds for the file to upload, then in the dropdown menu below 'Enter the name of the text column...' choose the column from the data file that you want to search.
3. Hit 'Load data'. The 'Load progress' text box will let you know when the file is ready.
4. In the 'Enter your search term' area below this, type in the key words you want to find in your text. Note that if the term is not spelled exactly as it is found in the text, it will not be found!
5. Hit search text. You may have to wait depending on the size of the data you are searching.
6. You will receive back 1. the top search result and 2. a csv of the search results found in the text ordered by relevance, joined onto the original columns from your data source.

## Semantic search

This search type enables you to search for broader themes (e.g. happiness, nature) and the search will pick out text passages that relate to these themes even if they don't contain the exact words.

1. Load in your tabular data file (.csv, .parquet, .xlsx - first sheet).
2. Wait a few seconds for the file to upload, then in the dropdown menu below 'Enter the name of the text column...' choose the column from the data file that you want to search.
3. Hit 'Load data'. The 'Load progress' text box will let you know when the file is ready.
4. In the 'Enter semantic search query here' area below this, type in the terms you would like to search for.
5. Press 'Start semantic search'. You may have to wait depending on the size of the data you are searching.
6. You will receive back 1. the top search result and 2. a csv of the search results found in the text ordered by relevance, joined onto the original columns from your data source.


# Advanced options
The search should perform well with default options, so you shouldn't need to change things here. More details on each parameter is provided below.

## Data load / save options
Toggle 'Clean text during load...' to "Yes" if you want to remove html tags and lemmatise the text, i.e. remove the ends of words to retain the core of the word e.g. searched or searches becomes search. Early testing suggests that cleaning takes some time, and does not seem to improve quality of search results.

'Return intermediate files', when set to "Yes", will save a tokenised text file (for keyword search), or an embedded text file (for semantic search) during data preparation. These files can then be loaded in next time alongside the data files to save preparation time for future search sessions.

'Round embeddings to three dp...' will reduce the precision of the embedding outputs to 3 decimal places, and will multiply all values by 100, reducing the size of the output numpy array by about 50%. It seems to have minimal effect on the output search result according to simple search comparisons, but I cannot guarantee this! 

## Keyword search options
Here are a few options to modify the BM25 search parameters. If you want more information on what each parameter does, click the relevant info button to the right of the sliders.

## Semantic search options
The only option here currently is the minimum similarity distance that should be included in the results. The default works quite well, anything above 0.85 tends to return no results in my experience.

## Join on additional dataframes to results
Join on additional data to the search results. This could be useful for example if you have tabular text data associated with a person ID, and after searching you would like to join on information associated with this person to aid with post-search filtering/analysis.

To do this:
1. Load in the tabular data you want to join in the box (.csv, .parquet, .xlsx - first sheet). 
2. Then choose the field that you want to join onto the results sheet, and the matching field from the data you are searching with.
3. Next time you do a search on the first tab, the new data should be joined onto your output file.
